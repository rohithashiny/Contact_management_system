# 📇 Contact Management System — Basic Edition

A simple Python project to manage your contacts — add, search, and view names and phone numbers — all from the terminal.  
Perfect if you’re learning Python and want to get hands-on with functions, loops, and dictionaries.

## ✨ What it does
This project helps you:
- ➕ **Add** new contacts (Name + Phone Number)  
- 🔍 **Search** for any saved contact  
- 📃 **Display** all your contacts neatly  
- 🚪 **Exit** whenever you’re done  

It’s lightweight, easy to understand, and doesn’t need any extra setup.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher  
- That’s it. No libraries, no dependencies. Just Python.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

### 🔁 Loops
- Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.  
- In this project, a `while True` loop keeps showing the main menu until the user chooses to exit.  
- The `break` statement is used to stop the loop.  

**Types of Loops in Python:**
1. `for` loop → used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).  
2. `while` loop → runs as long as a condition is true (used in this project).

---

### 🧩 Functions
- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  
- They make the program modular, clean, and easy to manage.  
- Each major feature (Add, Search, Display) is written as a separate function in this project.  

**Types of Functions:**
1. **Built-in Functions** → Already provided by Python (e.g., `print()`, `input()`, `len()`).
2. **User-defined Functions** → Created by the programmer using the `def` keyword (like `add_contact()`).
```
**Syntax Example:**
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value
